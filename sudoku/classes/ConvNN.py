"""
In PyTorch, convolutional layers are defined as torch.nn.Conv2d, 
there are 5 important arguments we need to know:

    in_channels: how many features are we passing in. 
    Our features are our colour bands, in greyscale, 
    we have 1 feature, in colour, we have 3 channels.

    out_channels: how many kernels do we want to use. 
    Analogous to the number of hidden nodes in a hidden 
    layer of a fully connected network.

    kernel_size: the size of the kernel. 
    Above we were using 3x3. 
    Common sizes are 3x3, 5x5, 7x7.

    stride: the “step-size” of the kernel.

    padding: the number of pixels we should pad to the 
    outside of the image so we can get edge pixels.

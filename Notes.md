# Now that it talks to itself

## Add in prediction capabilities
- Already mostly done with /bt_predict

## Add a simple solving mechanism
- i think it should go:
[init_command -row -column -number]
- returns an updated board

## Add Pydantic Outmodels to each api call
- I think we just need to be more clever on how we structure the outmodel
